        This page provides a conceptual overview of how you can create and publish new libraries to extend Angular
        functionality.
        If you find that you need to solve the same problem in more than one application (or want to share your solution
        with other developers), you have a candidate for a library. A simple example might be a button that sends users
        to your company we
        that would be included in all applications that your company builds.
